"""
Power Hour replay updater.

Runs Fridays via GitHub Actions. Finds today's Power Hour recording in
Michelle's Grain workspace, grabs its share URL, and upserts it into
replays.json (keyed by date, so re-runs are harmless).

Env vars:
  GRAIN_API_TOKEN_V2  required - same token BIA's onboarding automation uses
  SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL   optional - posts a note on success or final failure
  FINAL_ATTEMPT       optional - "true" on the last cron slot of the day;
                      controls whether a miss is treated as a failure
  MANUAL              optional - "true" when triggered by hand (Stream Deck /
                      "Run workflow"). Looks for the newest Power Hour in the
                      last MANUAL_LOOKBACK_DAYS instead of the most recent
                      Friday, and treats "nothing found" as a failure so the
                      scheduled runs know they still have work to do.

Scheduled runs target the most recent Friday (ET) rather than "today" because
GitHub fires cron jobs hours late on low-traffic repos - late enough that a
Friday-evening slot can land on Saturday UTC.

Exit codes:
  0 = entry added, or already present, or not-found on a non-final attempt
  1 = hard error, not-found on the final attempt, or not-found on a manual run

The last line of output is always "RESULT: ..." so a caller (the Stream Deck
button) can show it without parsing the whole log.
